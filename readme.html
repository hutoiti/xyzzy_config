<h1>設定済みxyzzy</h1>
<p>xyzzy本体のライセンスと混ぜても大丈夫なライセンスがついているLispを詰め込んでいます。</p>
<h2>設定の方針</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Windows風のキーバインドに設定。
	<ul>
	  <li>自分で設定ができない人を主なターゲットとしているため。</li>
	  <li>ただし、拡張のキーバインドまで調整しきれないので winkey.l の設定も入れる。</li>
	  <li>デフォルトのキーバインドの方がいい人は $XYZZY/site-lisp/siteinit.l の該当箇所を削除し、バイトコンパイルし直して、ダンプファイルを再生成すること。</li>
	  <!-- li>もしくは、$XYZZY/site-lisp/packaged/keybind.l という名前のファイルを作り、ダンプファイルを再生成すること。</li -->
	  <!-- li>というか設定できるなら NetInstaller を設定して、NetInstaller で環境構築した方がいい。</li -->
	</ul>
  </li>
  <li>環境変数の設定が不要なように、すべてを $XYZZY/site-lisp/siteinit.l で設定。
	<ul>
	  <li>さらにホームディレクトリを基準としたパスは、すべて xyzzy インストールディレクトリを基準としたパスに設定し直す。</li>
	  <li>この副次的な効果として USB メモリに入れても問題なく使えるようになっているはず。</li>
	</ul>
  </li>
  <li>ライセンス上問題のない Lisp はとりあえず詰め込む。
	そのため設定せずただファイルを同梱しているだけというものもあり。
	<ul>
	  <li>Lisp のバックアップとしてもある程度機能するかもしれない。</li>
	</ul>
  </li>
  <li>設定を変更することは考えない。そのため NetInstaller は設定しない。</li>
  <li>DLL や exe に依存している場合は設定しない。</li>
  <!-- li>以下の順番でロードされるので、追加の設定をする場合は参考に。
	<ul>
	  <li>$XYZZY/site-lisp/packaged/before.l</li>
	  <li>$XYZZY/site-lisp/siteinit.l</li>
	  <li>$XYZZY/site-lisp/packaged/after.l</li>
	</ul>
  </li -->
</ul>
